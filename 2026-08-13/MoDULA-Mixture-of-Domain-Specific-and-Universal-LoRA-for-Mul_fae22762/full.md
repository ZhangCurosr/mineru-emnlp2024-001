## Abstract

The growing demand for larger-scale models in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) poses challenges for efficient training within limited computational resources. Tradi tional fine-tuning methods often exhibit instability in multi-task learning and rely heavily on extensive training resources. Here, we propose MoDULA (Mixture of Domain-Specific and Universal LoRA), a novel Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) paradigm for improved fine-tuning and param eter efficiency in multi-task learning. The paradigm effectively improves the multi-task capability of the model by training universal experts, domain-specific experts, and routers separately. MoDULA-Res is a new method within the MoDULA paradigm, which main tains the model’s general capability by connecting universal and task-specific experts through residual connections. The experimental results demonstrate that the overall performance of the MoDULA-Flan and MoDULA-Res methods surpasses that of existing fine-tuning methods on various LLMs. Notably, MoDULA-Res achieves more significant performance improvements in multiple tasks while reducing training costs by over 80% without losing general capability. Moreover, MoDULA displays flexible pluggability, allowing for the efficient addition of new tasks without retraining existing experts from scratch. This progressive training paradigm circumvents data balancing issues, enhancing training efficiency and model stability. Overall, MoDULA provides a scalable, cost-effective solution for fine-tuning LLMs with enhanced parameter efficiency and generalization capability.

## 1 Introduction

Recent advancements in open-source Large Language Models (LLMs), such as LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), Qwen (Bai et al., 2023), and Yi (Young et al., 2024), have achieved notable successes in natural language processing. However, the increasing complexity and growing size of these models make efficient training within limited computational resources challenging. Researchers tried to address this with Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), such as LoRA (Hu et al., 2021), Prefix Tuning (Liu et al., 2023), and (IA)<sup>3</sup> (Liu et al., 2022). LoRA has gained prominence for its high performance using low-rank matrices, but it often encounters instability when trained on large, mixed datasets. To mitigate this issue, MoLoRA (Zadouri et al., 2024) has been introduced by extending LoRA and integrating the Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) architecture as shown in Figure 1(a). This approach trains multiple LoRAadapters concurrently, each serving as an expert, to enhance the base LLMs’ generalization ability across diverse tasks. The integration of MoE into LoRA aims to improve training efficiency and stability, facilitating more effective fine-tuning of large-scale language models for a wide range of natural language processing applications.

Despite its advantages, MoLoRA has some limitations. One limitation is the absence of domainspecific LoRA adapters, as the same experts are employed universally across all tasks. This uniformity may limit the performance ceiling, especially for significantly distinct tasks like math and code, where the inclusion of domain-specific experts could potentially enhance performance (Zeng et al., 2021). Another challenge is the limited pluggability of MoLoRA; adding new task capabilities necessitates retraining all parameters from all experts, which can be inefficient and time-consuming.

To address the challenges, we propose a threestage training paradigm called MoDULA, where different domain-specific experts can be trained separately. Moreover, we introduce a more advanced method MoDULA-Res (Mixture of Domain-

![](images/c5f5a23bdf5ba805963b8c5d297e46eb9718c78f3008df1e60e22adaf02be4f3.jpg)

Specific and Universal LoRA with Residual Connection), which incorporates a residual structure to make the training more stable, as seen in Figure 1(c). Unlike MoLoRA, which employs multiple identical LoRA adapters as experts, our paradigm incorporates a universal expert alongside multi ple domain-specific experts. The universal expert learns task-agnostic representations, while each domain-specific expert operates as a bias adapter, focusing on domain-specific knowledge. Intuitively, arranging these adapters in parallel and allocating weights to each adapter via a router constitutes the MoDULA-Flan (Mixture of Domain-Specific and Universal LoRA with Flan Routing) method as seen in Figure 1(b). However, this method may potentially compromise universal capabilities. To address this, MoDULA-Res introduces a refined method that enables domainspecific experts to receive input from the output of the universal expert. This design ensures a coherent flow of information and facilitates the optimal integration of both universal and domain-specific expert functionalities through a residual connection. By dynamically adjusting the contributions of domain-specific experts, MoDULA-Res adapts to individual tasks while preserving broad generalization capabilities. This flexibility allows the model to leverage its general competencies for task understanding and summarization when encountering new tasks, thereby achieving a more balanced and effective adaptation in multi-task scenarios.

During model training, our MoDULA employs a three-stage optimization process, with detailed illustrations displayed in Figure 2: 1) Initially, only the universal expert is trained to adapt to general tasks quickly; 2) Subsequently, each domainspecific expert is trained individually, focusing on its corresponding task; 3) Finally, the parameters of all experts are frozen, and only router is trained to learn the optimal combination strategy for different tasks. This progressive training paradigm allows our methods to avoid retraining from scratch, distinguishing it from MoLoRA, which trains only a new expert for a new specific task and retraining the router. This paradigm significantly reduces computational costs, mitigates data balancing challenges, and enhances the model’s pluggability.

To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, we conduct extensive experiments on a diverse set of open-source LLMs, including LLaMA-2 (Touvron et al., 2023b), Qwen (Bai et al., 2023), and Yi (Young et al., 2024), across various tasks. The results consistently demonstrate that MoD-ULA exhibits a significant performance, achieving 4.5% improvements compared to MoLoRA. By introducing residual connections, MoDULA-Res achieves even greater improvements without compromising the general capabilities. Additionally, our approach showcases superior adaptability to new tasks, outperforming MoLoRA in finance and e-commerce domain with less training data and parameters, highlighting the enhanced task pluggability of our approach, making it an efficient and general solution for multi-task learning in LLMs.

## 2.1 Large Language Model

Recently, the field of natural language processing has witnessed a paradigm shift with the advent of LLMs (Anil et al., 2023b; Almazrouei et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023; Scao et al., 2022; Brown et al., 2020; Achiam et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023; Du et al., 2022). These state-of-the-art models have departed from traditional approaches that relied on convolutional or recurrent architectures for feature extraction, instead embracing novel techniques such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), which leverages the power of Transformers trained on extensive datasets, yielding bidirectional encoder representations. Similarly, Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) (Brown et al., 2020) employs decoder layers from Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) as feature extractors and utilizes autoregressive training on vast texts.

Guided by the principles of scaling laws (Kaplan et al., 2020), the development of LLMs has led to the emergence of colossal models boasting over 100 billion parameters, with prominent examples including GPT-4 (Achiam et al., 2023) and Gemini (Anil et al., 2023a). Interestingly, open-source models such as OPT (Zhang et al., 2022), Falcon (Almazrouei et al., 2023), and Gemma (Mesnard et al., 2024) have demonstrated competitive performance compared to their closed-source counterparts, despite possessing a more modest parameter count. The training process of LLMs typically involves leveraging immense amounts of textual data to enable the prediction of subsequent tokens, empowering these models to generate coherent and comprehensible responses to a wide range of prompts. This training method has proven to be highly effective in capturing the intricacies of language and paved the way for LLMs to achieve SOTA performance across various NLP tasks.

## 2.2 MoE for PEFT

Our research closely aligns with the work done by MoLoRA (Zadouri et al., 2024), LoraHub (Huang et al., 2023a), MoELoRA (Liu et al., 2024), SiRA (Zhu et al., 2023), and C-Poly (Wang et al., 2023), which explore the intersection of PEFT and MoE. MoLoRA employs a full soft MoE on top of LoRA, utilizing a learned gating mechanism to average all experts, and trains the experts in a single stage. LoraHub investigates LoRA composability for cross-task generalization and introduces a simple framework for the purposive assembly of LoRA modules trained on diverse given tasks, aiming to achieve adaptable performance on unseen tasks. It can fluidly combine multiple LoRA modules with just a few examples from a new task, without requiring additional model parameters or human expertise. MoELoRA devises multiple experts as the trainable parameters and proposes a task-motivated gate function for all MOELoRA layers to regulate the contributions of each expert and generate distinct parameters for various tasks. SiRA proposes a sparse mixture of low rank adaption that enforces the top k experts’ routing with a capacity limit. It uses expert dropout to reduce over-fitting. C-Poly combines task-common skills and task-specific skills and jointly learns a skill assignment matrix.

While these methods have significantly contributed to the field, they face particular challenges and limitations. Training experts on mixed datasets as in MoLoRA may lead to performance degradation due to data inconsistency and interference (Dong et al., 2024). LoraHub relies on fewshot examples in inference stage, and MoELoRA requires task-id to determine which experts should be activated, which weaken the flexibility of both methods. Sparse routing, as used by SiRA, requires careful tuning of the top-k and capacity hyperparameters for each dataset. C-Poly’s joint learning of task-common and task-specific skills can make balancing general and specialized abilities difficult. Additionally, incorporating new experts or skills in these methods may require retraining or modifying existing components, potentially impacting system stability and training complexity. Training new experts often demands substantial data, resulting in high training costs and sub-optimal performance in specific domains. Maintaining optimal performance on domain-specific benchmarks after adding new capabilities can be challenging, and newly added modules may not consistently achieve top performance in their respective benchmarks. These factors can affect the adaptability and efficiency of MoLoRA, SiRA, and C-Poly in meeting expanding task demands.

In contrast, MoDULA method trains universal and domain-specific experts separately, mitigating performance degradation from mixed datasets. Designed with "pluggability" in mind, the MoD-ULA method allows new experts to be added without changing existing ones, ensuring system stability and low training costs. After adding a new expert, only the router requires retraining to maintain near-optimal performance. This staged training balances general and domain-specific capabilities, making our method adaptable and efficient for growing task requirements.

## 3 Method

In this section, we present MoDULA for LLM fine-tuning. Within this paradigm, we propose Realistic Tensor Flow ……. Hypothetical Tensor Flow

Figure 2: Illustrations of the three-stage training paradigm for MoDULA-Res.

two methods: MoDULA-Flan and MoDULA-Res. MoDULA-Flan consists of a universal expert and an array of domain-specific experts, while MoDULA-Res further incorporates residual connections between the universal and domain-specific experts to enhance performance and stability. Figure 1 illustrates the differences between MoLoRA, our proposed MoDULA-Flan and MoDULA-Res. In all of these, the base LLMs retain a frozen weight configuration, denoted as $W _ { 0 } .$ , corresponding to the fixed linear layers within the architecture.

MoLoRA. The MoLoRA method serves as the foundation of our MoDULA. As shown in Figure 1(a), the MoLoRA consists of a router $\theta _ { R } ^ { M }$ and a set of LoRA experts $E _ { 1 } , E _ { 2 } , \ldots , E _ { n }$ . Each expert $E _ { i }$ includes two key components: $B _ { i } ^ { M }$ and $A _ { i } ^ { M }$ . The dynamics of the MoLoRA method can be summarized by the following equations:

$$
s _ { i } ^ { M } = \theta _ { R } ^ { M } ( x _ { m } ) _ { i } = s o f t m a x ( W _ { R } ^ { M } x _ { m } ) _ { i }\tag{1}
$$

$$
y _ { m } ^ { M } = E ^ { M } ( x _ { m } ) + W _ { 0 } x _ { m }\tag{2}
$$

$$
E ^ { M } ( x _ { m } ) = \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { n } s _ { i } ^ { M } B _ { i } ^ { M } A _ { i } ^ { M } x _ { m }\tag{3}
$$

In these equations, $x _ { m }$ represents the hidden vector of the m-th token in the input sequence, $s _ { i } ^ { M }$ denotes the routing coefficient for expert $E _ { i } , W _ { R } ^ { M }$ is the weight matrix of the router, and $E ^ { M } ( \cdot )$ expresses the collective function of the experts in the MoLoRA module.

MoDULA. Based on MoLoRA, we propose a three-stage training paradigm called MoDULA, as illustrated in Figure 2. In the first stage, only the universal expert is trained, while the domainspecific experts and router are deactivated. In the second stage, the domain-specific experts are trained individually for each corresponding task, while the parameters of the universal expert are kept frozen. In the third stage, all the experts’ parameters are fixed, and only the router is trained. With the MoDULA paradigm, we propose two methods: MoDULA-Flan and MoDULA-Res.

MoDULA-Flan. MoDULA-Flan maintains the same architecture as MoLoRA, as illustrated in Figure 1(b). However, it implements the MoDULA paradigm to separate the experts in MoLoRA into universal expert and domain-specific experts. The specific training details are as follows. In the first stage, the universal expert $E _ { * } ^ { f l a n }$ is trained on universal datasets. In the second stage, the domain-specific experts $E _ { 1 } ^ { f l a n } , E _ { 2 } ^ { f l a n } , \cdot \cdot \cdot , E _ { n } ^ { f l a n }$ are trained on their respective domain-specific datasets. The forward process in this stage is formally articulated through Equations (4) and (8).

$$
y _ { m } ^ { f l a n } = E _ { i } ^ { f l a n } ( x _ { m } ) + W _ { 0 } x _ { m }\tag{4}
$$

where $i \in \{ 1 , 2 , \ldots , n \}$ . In the third stage, the parameters of all experts are kept frozen, and only the router $\theta _ { R } ^ { f l a n }$ is trained. The calculation involved in this routing determination is formally illuminated through the following equations:

$$
s _ { i } ^ { f l a n } = \theta _ { R } ^ { f l a n } ( x _ { m } ) _ { i } = s o f t m a x ( W _ { R } ^ { f l a n } x _ { m } ) _ { i }\tag{5}
$$

$$
y _ { m } ^ { f l a n } = E ^ { f l a n } ( x _ { m } ) + W _ { 0 } x _ { m }\tag{6}
$$

$$
E ^ { f l a n } ( x _ { m } ) = \sum _ { i } s _ { i } ^ { f l a n } E _ { i } ^ { f l a n } ( x _ { m } )\tag{7}
$$

$$
E _ { i } ^ { f l a n } ( x _ { m } ) = B _ { i } ^ { f l a n } A _ { i } ^ { f l a n } x _ { m }\tag{8}
$$

MoDULA-Res. In order to further improve the general ability of the model, we propose MoDULA-Res, a more advanced method that leverages the strengths of both universal and domain-specific experts. The architecture of MoDULA-Res is shown in Figure 1(c). MoDULA-Res integrates both the universal expert $E _ { * } ^ { r e s }$ and the domain-specific experts $E _ { 1 } ^ { r e s } , E _ { 2 } ^ { r e s } , \ldots , E _ { n } ^ { r e s }$ , tuned in a balanced way to cater to both general and domain-specific tasks. MoDULA-Res introduces a residual connection that allows the model to incorporate the output of universal expert directly into the final result, ensuring that critical information is preserved and enhancing model robustness.

The forward process in MoDULA-Res module involves two stages. Initially, a hidden vector $h _ { m }$ is computed using the universal expert:

$$
h _ { m } = B _ { * } ^ { r e s } A _ { * } ^ { r e s } x _ { m }\tag{9}
$$

where $x _ { m }$ is the hidden vector for the m-th token, and $B _ { * } ^ { r e s }$ and $A _ { * } ^ { r e s }$ correspond to the universal expert matrices. Subsequently, the hidden vector $h _ { m }$ is refined by the domain-specific experts with residual connection to produce the final output $y _ { m } ^ { r e s }$ :

$$
y _ { m } ^ { r e s } = E ^ { r e s } ( h _ { m } ) + W _ { 0 } x _ { m } + h _ { m }\tag{10}
$$

where the function $E ^ { r e s } ( \cdot )$ represents the operation of the domain-specific experts:

$$
E ^ { r e s } ( h _ { m } ) = \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { n } s _ { i } ^ { r e s } B _ { i } ^ { r e s } L e a k y R e L U ( A _ { i } ^ { r e s } h _ { m } )\tag{11}
$$

$s _ { i } ^ { r e s }$ is the weight for each expert, computed as:

$$
s _ { i } ^ { r e s } = \theta _ { R } ^ { r e s } ( x _ { m } ) _ { i } = s o f t m a x ( W _ { R } ^ { r e s } x _ { m } ) _ { i }\tag{12}
$$

This integration of a three-stage training paradigm and residual connection ensures that the MoDULA-Res module effectively generalizes and specializes simultaneously, thereby enhancing performance across both broad and focused applications.

## 4 Experiments

## 4.1 Expert Configurations

A detailed comparison is conducted among the standard LoRA (Hu et al., 2021), MoLoRA (Zadouri et al., 2024), and our newly proposed MoDULA-Flan and MoDULA-Res. The base models selected for this study include LLaMA-2 (Touvron et al., 2023b), Qwen (Bai et al., 2023), and Yi (Young et al., 2024). In the training of MoDULA, a batch size of 128 is utilized, encompassing 1 epoch with a learning rate of 2e-4. The maximum input sequence length is defined as 4096 tokens for both LLaMA-2 and Yi. In contrast, Qwen series has 8192 tokens due to variations in maximum positional embeddings among different model zoos. The intrinsic rank is configured to 16 for universal and 8 for domain-specific experts. For the multitask results, the checkpoint selection is based on the average metrics across all tasks. To enhance finetuning efficiency, we leverage libraries like HuggingFace’s Transformers (Wolf et al., 2020) and PEFT (Mangrulkar et al., 2022), based on which we design MoDULA.

and the Medical (Jin et al., 2019) dataset. General capabilities are measured via MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021) and C-Eval (Huang et al., 2023b) benchmarks, which both cover a wide range of tasks. To evaluate the pluggability and adaptability of different methods on new domain-specific tasks, we test their performance on the FinGPTheadline (Yang et al., 2023) dataset from the finance domain, as well as the Title-Optimization and Keyword-Recommendation datasets from the e-commerce domain.

Title optimization and keyword recommendation are critical tasks in e-commerce that aim to enhance product visibility and market responsiveness. These tasks involve integrating high-exposure queries from specific leaf categories into product titles to refine original titles and generate new keywords, ultimately achieving a higher Click-Through Rate (CTR). By evaluating the methods of these real-world e-commerce tasks, we can assess their effectiveness in capturing domain-specific knowledge and potential for practical application in industry settings. The specific evaluation metrics used for each benchmark are summarized in Table 2, providing a clear overview of the performance measures employed in our experiments.

## 4.4 Main Experimental Results

Our experimental results yield several significant observations that demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed approach, providing valuable insights into its performance across various benchmarks and real-world applications.

Superior Advancement over Baselines: Table 1 highlights the significant performance improvements achieved by our proposed paradigm across Qwen, LLaMA-2, and Yi. Models that are fine-tuned with our paradigm outperform the base models by an average of 16.6% and surpass the performance of MoLoRA by 6.3% on average. Notably, Yi demonstrates the most substantial improvement, with an impressive average increase of 10.9% over MoLoRA.

Further analysis reveals that performance advancements are more pronounced in smaller-scale models than in their larger counterparts, e.g., 4.9% for Qwen-7B while 2.9% for Qwen-14B. This indicates that small-scale models with fewer parameters and inadequate training are more prone to losing general capability when learning multiple tasks, while residual connections can effectively mitigate this problem.

Moreover, MoDULA-Flan does not consistently outperform MoLoRA, suggesting that it has the issue of decreased general capabilities (for example, the arithmetic benchmark of LLaMA-2-13B dropped sharply due to the decline in text understanding ability). In contrast, MoDULA-Res addresses this issue by introducing residual connections for general and expert modules, leading to more stable performance and significant improvements over MoLoRA and MoDULA-Flan.

Despite MoDULA-Res demonstrates overall strong performance, it faces challenges with GSM8K and MedQA tasks, likely due to the mismatch between pre-training data and task-specific requirements. We recognize these limitations and leave them for further research.

Excellent Robustness on Comprehensive Benchmarks: In order to determine whether the general capability of MoDULA-Res trained on multiple tasks will decline, we conduct experiments using the base, MoLoRA, and the MoDULA-Res model on the comprehensive benchmarks MMLU and C-Eval.

The results in Table 3 indicate that the average performance of MoDULA-Res across multiple models is about 1% higher than that of MoLoRA and the base model, suggesting that the model’s general capability is maintained and even partially improved through residual connection.

Flexible Pluggability over Baselines: To showcase MoDULA-Res’s pluggability, we introduce the finance domain (FinGPT-headline) in addition to the initial domains of mathematics, coding, and medical care. Then, we retrained MoLoRA, MoDULA-Flan, and MoDULA-Res, respectively. MoLoRA is trained from scratch on the combined dataset, while MoDULA-Flan and MoDULA-Res only require training a new financial expert and the router. This results in MoDULA-Flan and MoDULA-Res using only 19.8% and 37.3% of the training parameters and data compared to MoLoRA, respectively.

The results in Table 4 indicate that MoDULA-Res achieves the best average multi-task performance among the three models, with an average improvement of 8.0% in the financial task. Notably, the overall improvement of Yi-6B is more significant, exceeding 11.0%, due to the fewer parameters and relatively balanced pre-training data. MoLoRA encounters issues with data balance, requiring numerous experiments to adjust the data ratio for each task to achieve the best overall performance when new domain-specific tasks are introduced, which is time-consuming and laborintensive.

Outstanding Performance in E-Commerce: To assess MoDULA’s practical applicability in ecommerce, we introduce title optimization and keyword recommendation tasks, which involve refining titles and generating keywords using highexposure queries to enhance readability and include more key points. We employ GPT-4 to evaluate the optimized titles and keywords across five dimensions: helpfulness, relevance, accuracy, readability, and fluency. Each dimension is scored 0, 1, or 2, with a maximum total score of 10.

Table 5 demonstrates that MoDULA-Res significantly improves performance on title optimization and keyword recommendation benchmarks, with gains of 44.7% and 24.3% over MoLoRA, respectively. Moreover, MoDULA-Res maintains superior performance on the original multi-task benchmarks. These results highlight MoDULA-Res’s potential for e-commerce applications and adaptability to new tasks under resource constraints.

## 4.5 Analysis on Domain-specific Experts Allocation

To further analyze MoDULA-Res, router distributions for domain-specific experts based on Yi-6B and Qwen-14B are visualized in Figure 3. Models in Table 1 are reused, and we select layer 0-10- 20-30 and 10-20-30-40 for Yi-6B and Qwen-14B, respectively.

The results indicate that for both the Yi and Qwen models, the router within the MoD-ULA paradigm allows various experts to concentrate on their own domain. However, the interpretation of expert assignments varies across different layers in different models due to the model’s training data and method. For instance, Yi’s deeper layers focus more on separating experts, while Qwen in the shallower layers.

## 5 Conclusion

In this paper, we introduce MoDULA, a novel multi-stage training PEFT MoE paradigm that enhances efficiency and domain-specific adaptation for LLMs. By integrating universal and domainspecific experts through a three-stage training methodology, MoDULA optimizes both generalization and specialized performance. Experiments on various open-source LLMs, such as LLaMA-2,

Figure 3: Router distributions of MoDULA-Res based on Yi-6B (left) and Qwen-14B (right) on domain-specific tasks.

Qwen, and Yi, demonstrate that MoDULA outperforms existing methods, achieving over 80% reduction in training costs and a 5% performance improvement. These results highlight MoDULA’s potential as a scalable and efficient solution for fine-tuning LLMs, paving the way for future advancements in NLP.

## Limitations

While our proposed MoDULA paradigm shows significant advancements in parameter efficiency and multi-task adaptability for LLMs, there are still some limitations that need to be addressed. Despite the overall strong performance of MoDULA-Res, it shows sub-optimal results on certain benchmarks like GSM8K and MedQA. This may be due to discrepancies between the model’s pre-training data and the specific task datasets, requiring further investigation to identify the root causes and develop targeted solutions. Our experiments also focus on a limited set of language models (LLaMA-2, Qwen, Yi) and domain-specific tasks (mathematics, coding, medical, finance, e-commerce). To establish stronger generalizability, it would be valuable to extend our evaluations to a broader range of base models and diverse task domains. Furthermore, the current study primarily emphasizes the pluggability and training efficiency of MoDULA when incorporating new domain experts. However, the scalability and robustness of this approach when integrating a larger number of experts require further exploration and stress testing.

Future research directions include investigating techniques to mitigate performance degradation on specific benchmarks, conducting comprehensive evaluations on a wider range of models and tasks, exploring the scalability limits of expert integration, streamlining the multi-stage training process, and enhancing the interpretability of the router’s decision-making. By acknowledging these limitations and outlining potential avenues for future work, we aim to provide a balanced perspective on the current state of our research and highlight opportunities for further advancements in PEFT for LLMs.

The residual connection’s impact varies among models. For instance, Qwen-7B and Yi-6B models show significant score improvements of 1.71 and 3.01 points, respectively, whereas LLaMA-2-7B shows a smaller gain of 1.77 points. This suggests that the benefits may be model-specific, meriting further investigation.

In domain-specific tasks, MoDULA-Res excels, particularly in mathematics and medical fields. For example, in Arithmetic and Medical datasets, MoDULA-Res exceeds its non-residual variant by over 5 points, signifying the residual connection’s role in effective knowledge transfer.

However, in some tasks like MBPP and MedQA, the non-residual model slightly outperforms MoDULA-Res. This nuance suggests a need to further analyze the residual connection’s mechanism across various tasks to improve the model’s robustness.

In conclusion, the findings affirm the MoDULA-Res method’s efficacy. Residual connections significantly enhance overall performance on domainspecific tasks, offering a promising avenue for future enhancements in the PEFT paradigm.
