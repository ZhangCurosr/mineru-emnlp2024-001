## Abstract

Large vision language models (VLMs) have demonstrated significant potential for integration into daily life, making it crucial for them to incorporate human values when making decisions in real-world situations. This paper introduces VIVA, a benchmark for VIsiongrounded decision-making driven by human VAlues. While most large VLMs focus on physical-level skills, our work is the first to examine their multimodal capabilities in leveraging human values to make decisions under a vision-depicted situation. VIVA contains 1,240 images depicting diverse real-world situations and the manually annotated decisions grounded in them. Given an image there, the model should select the most appropriate action to address the situation and provide the relevant human values and reason underlying the decision. Extensive experiments based on VIVA show the limitation of VLMs in using human values to make multimodal decisions. Further analyses indicate the potential benefits of exploiting action consequences and predicted human values. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Derekkk/ VIVA\_EMNLP24.

## 1 Introduction

Imagine an elderly person falling on the ground, as in Figure 1: bystanders must recognize the fall (perception), assess the situation (reasoning and comprehension), and take decisive action by calling emergency services (action). Similarly, if someone is seen struggling in the water, it is imperative to recognize their distress and respond promptly by providing assistance, such as locating and deploying a flotation device. These reflect human values —fundamental principles that guide how people evaluate situations and make decisions aimed at fostering a harmonious society by promoting the wellbeing of individuals and the community (Schwartz and Bilsky, 1987; Schwartz, 2017).

Figure 1: Two vision-grounded decision-making examples with human values ( ). The best decision is in the blue box.

Meanwhile, recent large vision language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable intelligence and proficiency across diverse tasks (Liu et al., 2024b). As VLM-powered intelligent agents become increasingly integrated into our daily lives, e.g., embodied robots, it presents a pressing need for VLMs to gain human values for coexistence and collaboration between humans and future AI agents in society (y López et al., 2002; Savarimuthu et al., 2024). For this reason, exploring VLMs’ abilities in making vital decisions with the consideration of society-level human values is an important criterion for progress toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) (Morris et al., 2023; Feng et al., 2024).

However, it is challenging for VLMs to understand human values and make vision-grounded decisions accordingly because the task requires a deep, cross-modal comprehension of the scene and the underlying human values (Hu and Shu, 2023; Eigner and Händler, 2024). For instance, viewing a person struggling in the water in Figure 1, the model must infer the potential risk of drowning and the urgency of assistance. Here, a nuanced understanding of the situation (the person in distress) and human values (the duty to help others in need while maintaining personal safety) should jointly inform the best decision (employing a flotation device).

Given this challenge, we present VIVA, a pioneering benchmark aimed at evaluating the VIsiongrounded decision-making capabilities of VLMs with human VAlues for real-world scenarios. Our benchmark targets fundamental scenarios where universal values are at stake, highlighting essential considerations in human-centered decision-making. Although human values are gaining increasing attention in NLP communities, most work focuses on language-only scenarios (Sorensen et al., 2024), ignoring their impact in vision-grounded applications. Moreover, most VLM studies center primarily on the physical-level capabilities (Bitton et al., 2023; Ying et al., 2024; Li et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2024). As a result, existing VLMs may lack sufficient coverage of in-depth social-level reasoning and humancentered decision-making abilities. While Roger et al. (2023) examine the existence of ethical issues in images, VIVA covers a broader range of human values and takes a step further by incorporating these values into multimodal decision-making.

To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to explore multimodal decision-making with an awareness ofhuman values. We present the first benchmark for this task with a comprehensive experimental study to assess the capabilities of VLMs in predicting surface actions and underlying values in vision-depicted situations. The findings will provide valuable insights into the development of socially responsible and human-centered AI, which will be highly beneficial to the AGI advancement.

Concretely, VIVA contains 1,240 images covering a broad spectrum of real-life situations pertinent to human values, e.g., providing assistance, handling emergencies, addressing social challenges, and safeguarding vulnerable populations. Each image is meticulously annotated with potential courses of action, pertinent human values influencing decision-making, and accompanying reasons. Building upon this dataset, we devise tasks structured at two levels. Level-1: given an image depicting a situation, the model must select the most suitable action from distractions, demonstrating a nuanced understanding and reasoned analysis of the scenario. Level-2: the model is prompted to articulate the underlying human values and reasons supporting the previously chosen action. Our benchmark presents a non-trivial challenge, demanding that the model: (1) accurately perceive and interpret the image; (2) contextualize the situation with social reasoning; and (3) select appropriate action guided by relevant human values.

Figure 2: Instances of different tasks of our dataset. Our tasks assess the explicit actions taken and the underlying values and reason behind those actions.

We assess both commercial and open-sourced VLMs through extensive evaluations. Our results reveal that even the state-of-the-art models like GPT4-V encounter challenges with our task, achieving a combined accuracy of 74.9% for Level-1 action selection and Level-2 human-value inference. We then conduct in-depth analyses to identify features that could help decision-making and find that incorporating either action consequences or predicted human values is beneficial. Finally, we discuss how models perform across various scenarios and analyze errors to provide further insights.

In summary, our contributions are three-fold:

• We present a pilot study on the task of visiongrounded decision-making with human values;

• We construct a multimodal benchmark covering a wide range of situations, with annotations of actions, underlying human values, and reasons;

• We provide extensive experiments about VLM performance for our task and thorough analyses.

## 2 Task Design

Here, we present how we design our task to assess the ability of VLMs to handle real-world situations based on human values. The challenging task demands precise perception, comprehension, and the capacity to make decisions by leveraging the implicit relations between the vision-depicted situation and human values. Our task design assesses the decision-making capabilities of VLMs through two-level tasks, which examine both explicit actions and the underlying values and reasoning behind action selection, as depicted in Figure 2.

![](images/0ffb51ca7444224cf53ab5b55f3bb48c964e871a1dc1235afad460188655f568.jpg)  
Figure 3: The VIVA benchmark construction pipeline overview. The process begins with brainstorming diverse textual situation descriptions leveraging GPT. Then, we gather images corresponding to the situations described using image searches. After that, human annotators collaborate with GPT to write and verify the components for each task to ensure overall data quality.

Level-1 task on action selection. Our Level-1 task design evaluates the model’s ability to choose an appropriate action in response to a given situation. To allow feasible evaluation, we frame this task as a multiple-choice question: given an image (i) representing the situation, along with a question (q) and five options for potential actions, the model is tasked with selecting the most suitable option (a).

Level-2 tasks on value and reason. This task is designed to further examine whether the models truly understand the action selected in the Level-1 task. We require the models to base their decisions on accurate human values and provide appropriate reasoning to justify the selection. Therefore, we incorporate human values and a reason to assess the implicit rationale behind the model’s prediction.<sup>1</sup>

We start by associating each situation with a set of underlying human values ( v<sub>i</sub> ). We follow the previous work (Forbes et al., 2020; Sorensen et al., 2024) to represent values as a general plural value concept (e.g., Duty to help) with a brief situationrelated judgment (e.g., Feeling a moral obligation to aid someone in distress). These values are divided into two categories: positive values (supporting the action selected in the previous Level-1 task) and negative values (either irrelevant or contradictory to the selection). We then formalize value inference as a binary classification task: the input consists of the image, the Level-1 question and answer, and a value, while the output indicates how the value is related. Because each sample includes

Manual Annotationmultiple values, we average the accuracy across all corresponding values. The baseline accuracy for random guessing is 50%.

For a reason (to make the decision), we define it as a natural language expression that explains why the selected action is preferable. We frame the reason as a generation task: given an image, Level-1 question, and the answer, the model is required to produce an explanation to justify its selection. Compared to values, reasons offer a more detailed and nuanced rationale for explaining the selection.

## 3 Data Construction

Based on the task design in § 2, we construct our VIVA dataset through a multi-step annotation pipeline. It involves image collection, annotation of Level-1 and Level-2 tasks, and quality verification. The complete pipeline is depicted in Figure 3.

## 3.1 Situation-Relevant Image Collection

We start data collection by gathering images online via scraping from open-sourced websites, including Pinterest, Reddit, and Google Search. To allow a diverse range of real-life situations, we initially create a varied set of textual situation descriptions (e.g., "A visually impaired person is attempting to cross at a traffic light.") as seeds by our authors. We then utilize these seed descriptions to prompt ChatGPT to brainstorm additional situations. We limit the situation descriptions to one sentence and make them general enough to serve as queries for relevant image searches. After collecting the images, we perform de-duplication and filter out lowquality ones, as well as those containing offensive content or deemed inappropriate for our task. It results in a total collection of 1,240 final images.

Situation Diversity. Our collected images cover a broad spectrum of situations, as depicted in Figure 4. We classify these situations into various types, e.g., assisting people in distress, emergent situations, uncivilized behavior, child safety, etc. Additionally, we incorporate a category labeled "normal situation" featuring images depicting everyday activities that require no intervention, such as people surfing or lounging on grassland for relaxation. The purpose is to assess the models’ robustness to distractions to avoid false alarms. As for the completed category list and the corresponding illustrations, we refer the readers to Appendix A.3.

Figure 4: Categories of situations covered by our dataset. The illustrations of each category is provided in Appendix A.3

## 3.2 Task Annotation

For the groundtruth annotation of each component, we employ six in-house human annotators, all proficient English speakers with backgrounds in Computer Science. Besides, inspired by recent studies showing that incorporating large language models can effectively reduce human annotation efforts (Tian et al., 2023; Ding et al., 2023), we leverage GPT4-turbo (henceforth GPT in this section) to assist annotators for efficient annotations.

Action Annotation for Level-1 Task. For each image, we annotate five action candidates. In some cases, we include "No action is necessary" as one candidate to indicate the option of non-intervention, alongside four other specific actions. For effective evaluation, we make the distraction actions appear plausible but might potentially lead to worse consequences, or they are only valid under specific constraints. For example, in Figure 1, while helping lift a fallen elderly person to a couch may seem helpful, it could actually result in further injury in an emergent situation; similarly, witnessing someone drowning in water and directly jumping in for rescue ignores the potential risks to one’s own safety.<sup>2</sup> Making appropriate decisions requires joint consideration of various factors and world knowledge, which is a crucial ability for reliable AI agents.

Concretely, we first prompt GPT to generate initial multiple-choice questions with action candidates, and then we prompt it again to progressively modify the candidates and increase complexity (Tian et al., 2023). Next, human annotators select and modify the actions to annotate the final action candidates. After annotating all samples, each sample is assigned to another annotator for quality checks. In cases of ambiguity, one of the authors is involved to modify the annotations to reach an agreement. Through this process, we strive to ensure that the annotations reflect the collective value of how the majority of people tackle a social situation using commonly agreed-upon values.

Level-2 Value Annotation. We utilize knowledge distillation (West et al., 2022) to prompt GPT to generate a set of values based on the image and the action selection in the Level-1 task. Next, we prompt GPT to generate negative values, either irrelevant or contradictory to the correct action selection. Here, we define "negative" as situationrelevant, yet a negative value itself remains a correct human value irrespective of the situation or action. After that, human annotators write final annotations based on the GPT results. If GPT-generated values contain too specific details of the situation (rendering trivial answers), annotators rewrite and generalize it (e.g., "the woman drowning in water" "someone in distress"). Finally, we ensure that each sample has at least 2 values for both positive and negative classes. In total, 8,610 unique values are annotated for all situations in VIVA.

Level-2 Reason Annotation. Here, we ask human annotators to write a free-text reason for each sample to explain the rationale behind selecting the action. Unlike a single value focusing on a specific aspect, a reason offers a more thorough and nuanced explanation. Similarly, this process begins by prompting GPT to generate a result, which is then verified and edited by human annotators.

Quality Check. After the annotation, we implement a quality check process of VIVA, where each sample is further verified by a human annotator to ensure its correctness and reliability. Appendix A provides detailed statistics for each component.

Table 1: Main results. #Params is the size of corresponding LLMs. The combined scores assess the overall performance across both Level-1 and Level-2 tasks. Acc is the overall accuracy of the action-value results, and Acc @n indicates the accuracy of the action-reason results, with n as the threshold of the GPT score for the generated reason. Best scores are bold and the second best ones are marked with underline. We include GPT4-Turbo results only for reference and do not compare them with other model results to avoid potential biases stemming from its dual role in previous data annotations (see 3.2).

## 4 Experimental Setup

## 4.1 Models

We evaluate various publicly available VLMs based on VIVA. All the models are instructional VLMs, which predict results in a zero-shot prompting manner. For commercial models, we employ Claude3- Sonnet (Anthropic, 2024) and two versions of GPT4, GPT4-Vison (GPT4-V) and GPT4-Turbo (Achiam et al., 2023). For open-sourced models, we include LLaVA-1.5 (Liu et al., 2023a), LLaVA-NeXT (Liu et al., 2024a), MiniGPT4 (Zhu et al., 2023), mPLUG-Owl2 (Ye et al., 2023), Qwen-VL (Bai et al., 2023), and CogVLM (Wang et al., 2023). More model details are in Appendix B.

## 4.2 Evaluation Metrics

We use accuracy as the evaluation metric for Level-1 action selection and Level-2 value inference, both as classification tasks. Here, in action selection, which we frame as a multiple-choice question task, the baseline accuracy for random guesses is 20%. In value inference, one sample has multiple human values, with each human value treated as a binary relation prediction, and we report the accuracy of correctly predicted values for each sample, with a random guess baseline of 50%. For Level-2 reason generation, we consider two explanation scores: a semantic explanation score (CH-Wang et al., 2023), which calculates an average of BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2019) and BLUERT (Sellam et al., 2020); and a ChatGPT-based explanation score, utilizing

ChatGPT to assess the generated reason on a scale from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest.<sup>3</sup>

A model is assessed only on Level-2 samples for which the corresponding Level-1 answers are correct. To evaluate the overall performance of both Level-1 and Level-2 tasks for action selection and value inference (action-value), we report the combined accuracy of both tasks, calculated as the product of their individual accuracies so that both tasks are taken into account (Zellers et al., 2019). We denote this score as Acc<sub>V</sub>. For action selection and reason generation, following CH-Wang et al. (2023), we report accuracy at two thresholds of the ChatGPT explanation score (Acc<sub>R</sub>@n): n=4 or 5. Acc<sub>R</sub>@n only considers correctly predicted labels of action selection that achieve a ChatGPT score of the generated reason equal to or greater than n as correct.

## 5 Experimental Results and Analysis

## 5.1 Main Results

The main results are shown in Table 1. As can be seen, GPT4-V shows superiority in action selection and value inference, yet its score for reason generation is comparatively lower than the other two commercial models. It may result from GPT4- V’s superior vision understanding and reasoning capabilities over language abilities. In contrast, Claude3, despite lower scores in action selection, shows strengths in value inference and reason generation, highlighting its better language abilities.

Open-source models are generally outperformed by commercial models. Among them, LLaVA variants often demonstrate better capabilities in value-related decision-making tasks. It could be attributed to their good reasoning abilities and world knowledge (Liu et al., 2024a, 2023b). Notably, open-source models often face challenges in inferring underlying values, especially when contrasted with commercial models. It suggests that while these models can select correct actions, their rationale may not consistently align with human values, which may render unreliable and uncontrollable model behavior in real-world scenarios. In addition, smaller models (7B) typically underperform compared to their larger counterparts (13B). Nevertheless, applications like embodied agents often necessitate smaller model footprints for swift decision-making in real-time environments, highlighting the critical need to align these models to consistently uphold human values in their actions.

Table 2: Model results on level-1 action selection with the incorporation of predicted consequence. Original is the accuracy without consequence. GPT4-V, Self, and Llama-Pred. are consequences predicted by GPT4-V, the model itself, and our proposed Llama prediction module, respectively.

Viewing the challenges above, in §5.2 and §5.3, we explore the potential features to enhance models’ decision-making, which is directly reflected by better selections of actions in the Level-1 task.

## 5.2 Predicting Consequences in Advance Can Improve Model Decision Making

One possible reason of VLMs inferior performance lies in their model structure: current language models predict outputs autoregressively at the token level in a left-to-right single pass. It contrasts with human cognition, which usually engages with robust reasoning by simulating actions and their potential outcomes (Hu and Shu, 2023; LeCun, 2022; Bubeck et al., 2023). Based on this intuition, we propose integrating a consequence prediction module to improve model decision-making results.

Preliminary Analysis. We instruct a model to predict the consequence of each action beforehand and integrate these anticipated outcomes into the prompt for Level-1 action selection. It allows models to mimic human’s decision-making practices (Gonzalez, 2017). Here, we initially use the GPT4-V predicted results because VIVA has no gold-standard consequences. As shown in Table 2, incorporating the predictions improves the performance of all models, including GPT4-V itself. However, using the consequences predicted by open-sourced models cannot result in performance gains and sometimes even leads to a decrease. It indicates that smaller models often lack the ability to accurately predict the consequences of each action, thereby limiting effective decision-making.

Consequence Prediction Module. To overcome the limitations observed in smaller models, we introduce a consequence prediction module designed to anticipate the potential outcomes of each action. This module takes a textual description of the situation and action candidates as input and predicts the potential consequences of those actions. For model training, we leverage GPT4 to generate weaklysupervised data for knowledge distillation. This approach yields a dataset comprising 2,050 training samples. Subsequently, we fine-tune a Llama3-8B model (AI@Meta, 2024) with LoRA (Hu et al., 2021) as the consequence predictor. Further details regarding the construction of training data and model parameters are provided in Appendix B.3.

To incorporate the module into the action selection, we first prompt a VLM to generate a short description of the image situation. The generated description and action candidates are then used for consequence prediction. The results are shown in Table 2. Incorporating this module (w/ Llama-Pred.) results in performance gains across all models, underscoring its effectiveness, except for LLaVA-Next 13B. This suggests that anticipating potential outcomes is crucial for enhancing the model’s decision-making ability. For LLaVA-Next 13B, upon a manual review, we found instances where the model-generated descriptions failed to accurately identify and encapsulate critical aspects of the situation, thereby leading to inaccurate consequences. We provide further discussions in §5.4.

## 5.3 Enhancing Action Selection Through Incorporation of Relevant Values

The challenge of our task may also come from inferring underlying human values. We then investigate if explicitly providing human values is helpful. Intuitively, humans often make decisions based on their beliefs and values when choosing a course of action (Fritzsche and Oz, 2007; Ravlin and Meglino, 1987). A natural question is, if a model possesses accurate values relevant to a given situation, can it determine appropriate actions? We begin by incorporating gold-standard values (i.e., oracle values) annotated by humans into the Level-1 action selection task. The results, shown in Figure 5, indicate that augmenting with oracle values significantly enhances the performance of all models compared to the results without values. It underscores the essential role of relevant values in the decision-making process for real-life scenarios.

![](images/8f0d141c958766b4ca96c4a05373904bf5140d0b4f8e53f12b6921f2c5e35208.jpg)  
Figure 5: Model accuracy (y-axis) on Level-1 action selection with the incorporation of oracle and predicted values.

Then, we explore the impact of augmenting the values generated by a VLM itself. We first prompt a model to produce relevant values given an input image and then incorporate these generated values for action selection. The results show that augmenting with GPT4-V-generated values leads to more accurate action selection. It indicates that GPT4-V can recognize and associate the situation with relevant values to enhance decision-making, whereas it is still less useful than human-written values.

In contrast, augmenting with values generated by other models does not lead to performance gains. It implies that current open-source VLMs still face challenges associating situations with relevant human values. This observation is also highlighted by the inferior Level-2 value inference task results in Table 1. These findings together reveal that current open-source models still lag behind GPT-4 in aligning with human values, emphasizing the need for future research to enhance VLMs’ alignment with human principles for improved decision-making.

## 5.4 In-Depth Analysis

While the above discussions centered on the overall performance, we further analyze how VLMs perform across various situations below. It is followed by a detailed error analysis to uncover their major weaknesses and explore the potential reasons.

Performance Across Different Situations. Figure 6 illustrates the performance of models across various types of situations. Commercial models consistently perform better than open-source ones over varying situation types. Also, similar to the trend in Table 1, the LLaVA-NeXT 13B model shows weaker performance in value inference, yet it excels in reason generation. Notably, models generally perform better in situations involving urgent issues (Emergent Situation) or situations requiring explicit assistance (People in Distress). Conversely, performance tends to drop in situations with less apparent signals for help, such as Everyday Living Assistance and Vulnerable Group Support. Another interesting observation is that open-source models are more prone to errors in Normal Situations (where no intervention is required) than commercial models. It suggests that open-source models are less robust when handling these distraction situations and are likely to render false alarms.

Figure 6: Model performance on different types of situation. We report Acc<sub>V</sub> for action-value results and Acc<sub>R</sub>@4 for action-reason results. Best viewed in color.

Error Analysis. We analyze errors of Level-1 action selection by examining the underlying reasons for incorrect predictions and presenting common types of action selection errors in Figure 7. The first type of error arises from incorrect recognition of the situation, where the model fails to accurately perceive and understand the visual content in the input image. For example, GPT-4 fails to recognize a woman’s injury and erroneously concludes that there is no visible evidence of an emergency or distress, leading to an incorrect action. The second common error arises from the misaligned association of values. As shown in the example of Figure 7, mPlug-Owl2 mistakenly associates the situation of cheating on an exam with values of empathy and kindness, leading to an action choice of assisting the individual with the test. This highlights the importance of future work in aligning models with relevant human values for better decision-making.

In addition, even when a model correctly identifies a situation, it can still make erroneous selections. The third type of error involves a mistakenly prioritized urgency. For example, upon witnessing a person who has slipped and fallen on a wet floor, the appropriate initial action should prioritize the immediate well-being and safety of the fallen individual. While humans can intuitively make this decision, VLMs often struggle to prioritize actions correctly. Furthermore, VLMs can provide unprofessional assistance, which may lead to worse consequences, as illustrated by the fourth type of error (e.g., moving an injured person without professional knowledge could worsen their condition). Making correct decisions requires commonsense knowledge and thoughtful consideration of potential outcomes. It highlights the need for future efforts to incorporate better consequence prediction modules for accurate decision-making. We provide more sample outputs in Appendix C.

## 6.1 VLMs and Evaluations

VLMs enable cross-modal processing of visual and textual inputs and provide free-form text output (Minaee et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024). They typically consist of a visual encoder, a large language model backbone, and a visual-language connection module to align the two modalities (Radford et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2024b; Bai et al., 2023). VLMs, demonstrating remarkable visual recognition, reasoning, and problem-solving abilities, have been applied to various downstream tasks (Liu et al., 2024a; Team et al., 2023). Our work is in line with VLMs studies, aiming to extensively explore VLMs’ ability for human-value-driven decision-

making.

Our work is specifically related to VLMs evaluations. Here recent work proposes various benchmarks, such as VisIT-Bench (Bitton et al., 2023), MMBench (Liu et al., 2023d), MMT-Bench (Ying et al., 2024), SEED-Bench (Li et al., 2023), MMMU (Yue et al., 2023) to evaluate general abilities of VLMs on various vision-language tasks. Other studies evaluate VLMs on specific aspects such as diagram understanding (Kembhavi et al., 2016), mathematical reasoning (Lu et al., 2023), visual commonsense reasoning (Zellers et al., 2019), and comic understanding (Hessel et al., 2023). Nevertheless, human values have not yet been extensively explored in vision-grounded scenarios, which is, however, crucial for applications like embodied agents (Brohan et al., 2023). Although PCA-Bench (Chen et al., 2024) explores embodied decision-making with world knowledge, it focuses on certain domains such as domestic robot and does not explicitly involve human values, e.g., caring for others. Roger et al. (2023) centers on ethical-issue existence in images, whereas our work covers a broader range of human values and involves them in real-life decision-making.

## 6.2 Human Value and Model Alignment

Our work is also inspired by previous studies aligning the model behavior to human values, which has drawn increasing attention in the NLP community (Liu et al., 2023c). They enable models to understand human values and norms (Jiang et al., 2021) including value modeling (Sorensen et al., 2024), situated moral reasoning (Emelin et al.,

2021; Forbes et al., 2020), and assessment of behavior in tasks like dialogue (Ziems et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2023) and story generation (Jiang et al., 2021). However, they mainly focus on the language perspective, while our study explores human values in vision-grounded decision-making. It requires multimodal skills to recognize and perceive the image, understand and reason the situation with relevant human values, and take appropriate actions. These have not been sufficiently included in the current VLM skillset, yet they are crucial for a trustworthy AGI.

## 7 Conclusion

This study presents VIVA, a pioneering benchmark crafted to evaluate vision-grounded decisionmaking in real-world situations with human values. Our benchmark encompasses diverse real-life scenarios, featuring tasks structured at two levels: action selection within vision-grounded contexts and the subsequent inference of underlying values and reason. We conduct experiments with recent VLMs and provide comprehensive analyses. The results reveal the ongoing challenge for current VLMs in making reliable decisions while considering human values. Moreover, the in-depth analysis shows that integrating the predicted action consequences and human values enhances decision-making efficacy.

## Limitations

Here we outline the limitations of our study. Firstly, while our research pioneers the evaluation of model decision-making abilities by formalizing the task as selecting the most appropriate action based on situations, real-world applications demand that models generate responses to situations, a more complex task than mere action selection. In future work, we will extend our task design to further evaluate model abilities on generating proper actions to handle a situation. Secondly, our annotated actions tend to be brief and to the point. However, addressing real-world situations often requires more detailed action scripts or a sequence of actions, delineating each step involved. In future endeavors, we aim to augment our benchmark by incorporating more intricate action sequences. Thirdly, our analysis underscores the utility of integrating predicted consequences and norms to bolster model performance. Nevertheless, accurately inferring these features poses a significant challenge for current VLMs. For instance, the efficacy of the consequence prediction module is heavily contingent upon the model’s proficiency in recognizing situational nuances from the input image. Our future plans involve devising better methods to enhance model performance in decision-making tasks.

Our benchmark primarily focuses on fundamental scenarios where collective moral values are at stake—principles that are broadly recognized and universally applicable, such as helping others in distress, showing empathy, and ensuring child safety. However, we recognize the potential for cultural differences and biases in values and their influence on decision-making. Moreover, compared to universal human values, we do not account for in-group variation of values in our benchmark. In future work, we aim to further explore these nuances by incorporating more contextual information and specific conditions for decision-making. Additionally, we will investigate de-biasing models and methods to ensure more accurate and contextually appropriate decision-making.

## Ethics Statements

Copyright and License. All images in VIVA benchmark are sourced from publicly available content on social media platforms. We guarantee compliance with copyright regulations by utilizing original links to each image without infringement. Additionally, we commit to openly sharing our annotated benchmark, with providing the corresponding link to each image. Throughout the image collection process, we meticulously review samples, filtering out any potentially offensive or harmful content.

Data Annotations with GPT. Our data annotation involves leveraging GPT to produce initial versions of each component, which are then verified and revised by human annotators. Despite our best efforts to ensure the quality of the annotations, we acknowledge that utilizing large language models may introduce potential bias. The generated results may tend to favor certain majority groups. Furthermore, our annotation and task design prioritize collective norms and values. For instance, when presented with a scenario involving a visually impaired individual struggling to cross the road, our action selection favors providing assistance rather than ignoring the situation and taking no action. To mitigate bias, our annotation process includes rigorous quality checks, with each sample annotated and reviewed by different human annotators

to reduce ambiguity.

Data Annotation and Potential Bias. Six annotators are engaged in our annotation process. All annotators are proficient English speakers and are based in English speaking areas. Before the annotation, we conducted thorough training and task briefing for our annotators, as well as a trial annotation to ensure they have a clear understanding of the research background and the use of the data. We compensate these annotators with an average hourly wage of \$10, ensuring fair remuneration for their contributions. The data collection process is conducted under the guidance of the organization ethics review system to ensure the positive societal impact of the project.

We took care to maintain quality during the annotation process by having each sample annotated and reviewed by multiple annotators. Our annotators, with significant lived experiences in cultural backgrounds including East Asia, Southeast Asia, and North America, provide a range of perspectives. While we strive to minimize biases, we acknowledge the potential for cultural differences in our final annotations.

Potential Usage. We open-source our benchmark for future studies. Regarding the potential usage of the dataset, we urge users to carefully consider the ethical implications of the annotations and to apply the benchmark cautiously for research purposes only.

## A Additional Details of VIVA Dataset

## A.1 Data Statistics

We present the statistics of each component and their corresponding lengths in Table 3. VIVA comprises a total of 1,240 image samples, with each sample containing a multiple-choice question featuring five actions. The average length of an action is 13.5 words, rendering this multiple-choice question task more challenging compared to many other QA tasks where answers are typically much shorter. For underlying values and reasons, the average number of words is 14.5 and 78.6, respectively. We also present word clouds of the annotated actions and values in Figure 8.

## A.2 Data Construction Details

Our data construction process involves a humanmachine collaboration method. Initially, we prompt GPT4 to generate a preliminary result for each component, which is then verified and modified by human annotators to produce the final annotations. In cases where GPT4-generated results are incorrect or of low quality, human annotators are tasked with writing a solution. The prompts used to generate the initial components are illustrated from Figure 13 to Figure 16.

For quality assurance of annotations, after a sample is annotated with actions for the Level-1 Task, we assign the sample to a different human worker to review the action annotations and then annotate the Level-2 components of values and reasons. Once all components are completed, each sample is further assigned to a different human worker to verify the components, ensuring the quality and establishing a common consensus on the previous annotations.

## A.3 Situation Category

We classify the situations in VIVA into nine categories, each representing different real-life scenarios. Figure 9 provides specific illustrations and corresponding examples for each category. Our dataset encompasses a diverse array of situations, including assisting people in need, addressing uncivilized and illegal behaviors, handling emergencies, and promoting child safety. Additionally, we include normal situations that do not require intervention to assess the robustness of models. It is worth noting that some categories may overlap; for example, an injured person might be classified as either in distress or in an emergency, depending on the context.

## A.4 Clusters of Values

To further understand and organize the values central to our work, we conduct analysis by clustering all values following (Sorensen et al., 2024) with ChatGPT. The summaries of clusters are shown as below. The resulting clusters reflect core principles that align with fundamental human values across diverse domains of life and ethical considerations, forming the foundation for ethical decision-making and social interactions.

• Safety and Well-being Prioritization

• Community Support and Social Responsibility

• Efficiency and Problem-Solving

• Respect for Autonomy and Independence

• Professionalism and Ethical Behavior

• Compassion and Empathy

• Safety and Emergency Preparedness

• Conflict Resolution and Non-Violence

• Promotion of Inclusivity and Support

using PyTorch and the HuggingFace/Transformers Library (Wolf et al., 2020). For MiniGPT-4, we use the version with Vicuna 13B as the LLM. The default parameters are employed for inference, and we enable FP16 to save memory. The specific prompts we use for inference are shown in Figure 10. All experiments are conducted on NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPUs.

In § 5.3, we show the impacts of incorporating the predicted values of a situation to enhance decision making. For value prediction, given an input image, we first prompt VLMs with one in-context sample to generate 5 short human values that are relevant to the decision making process for this situation. Then we include the generated values in the prompt for action selection.

## B.2 Evaluation Details

We formalize the Level-1 action selection and Level-2 value inference as classification tasks. To parse the model predicted label, we first design a set of rules to match a class label; if no label can be matched, we prompt ChatGPT to compared the model output with the options and parse the label. There are occasional cases where the model output cannot be parsed, we will consider this as a wrong prediction.

For Leve-2 value inference, assume a sample contains m values, where each value has a binary label. We calculate the accuracy of the sample by comparing the target labels of all values $\left\{ y _ { 1 } , y _ { 2 } , . . . , y _ { m } \right\}$ with the model predicted labels of values $\left\{ \bar { y } _ { 1 } , \bar { y } _ { 2 } , . . . , \bar { y } _ { m } \right\}$ for the proportion of the correct predictions.

To evaluate the overall performance of both Level-1 and Level-2 tasks for action selection and value inference (action-value), we report the combined accuracy of both tasks (Zellers et al., 2019). This score equals the value accuracy of the sample with correct Level-1 prediction, or 0 in the case of a wrong Level-1 prediction.

For reason generation evaluation, we follow CH-Wang et al. (2023) to adopt a semantic explanation score, which is calculated as the average of BERTScore and BLEURT. For BERTScore, we adopt the "microsoft/deberta-large-mnli" model. We implement both metrics using the Huggingface/Evaluate Library <sup>6</sup>. For GPT-based explanation score, we leverage ChatGPT to score the model generated reason on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 is the lowest and 5 is the highest. The prompt used for ChatGPT-based evaluation is shown in Figure 11.

## B.3 Details of Consequence Prediction Module

To train the consequence prediction module, we utilize GPT4-Turbo to generate weakly supervised training data. Prior research has demonstrated the effectiveness of leveraging GPT for this purpose (Wang et al., 2022). we first prompt GPT4 to create a textual description of a situation and propose a list of possible actions. Subsequently, we prompt GPT4 again to predict consequences resulting from the specified situation and actions. We limit a consequence to be described in one sentence. For example, given a situation and an action candidate:

\- Situation Description: An elderly person struggling to carry groceries across a busy street, emphasizing the need for assistance and support for vulnerable populations;

\- Action: Cross the street and offer to help carry the groceries

GPT4 generates a consequence as:

The elderly person may appreciate the assistance and feel supported.

This process results in a weakly-supervised dataset comprising 2,050 samples in total. Importantly, the data generation process described above does not utilize samples from the VIVA benchmark, ensuring no information leakage. Next, we fine-tune a LLama3-based consequence predictor. Specifically, we employ Lora for parameterefficient model training, setting the learning rate to 2e-4 with a cosine scheduler. The fine-tuning process includes configuring LoRA with a rank of 8, alpha of 16, and a dropout rate of 0.05 applied to the query and value projection layers. The model undergoes fine-tuning with a global batch size of 8 over 600 steps. The experiments are conducted on 4 NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPUs.

## C Additional Sample Outputs

In Figure 12, we present additional model outputs showcasing two error types. Regarding the Incorrect recognition of the situation, unlike the previous sample illustrated in Figure 7, where the model struggled to accurately recognize the content of the image, here the error arises from a misunderstanding of the scene and underlying world knowledge. In the first scenario depicting people crossing the street, although the models correctly identify the red light, they fail to comprehend that it pertains to the road, while the traffic light for the crosswalk should actually be green. Consequently, they erroneously perceive the individuals as disregarding the traffic light for crossing the road. Similarly, in the second image, the models overlook the fact that the person is wearing professional bee masks and might be a beekeeper, leading to incorrect action selections. These examples underscore the necessity for models to not only perceive image content accurately but also possess world knowledge to comprehend situations and select appropriate actions. This remains a challenging task for current VLMs. In conclusion, the results indicate a need for future research to enhance VLMs in two aspects: improving the vision component for more accurate image content comprehension, and enhancing the language model to incorporate broader world knowledge and conduct sound reasoning to understand the real-world situations.

We also provide two additional examples highlighting errors arising from incorrect association of values. In the first scenario, where the driver is identified as driving while drinking alcohol, the appropriate action is to advise the driver to stop driving and seek an alternative way of transportation. Despite VLMs recognizing the situation and advocating for safe driving, they still choose actions that are not appropriate, such as reminding the driver to be careful and attentive. While these actions begin from a commendable standpoint, they underestimate the gravity of drinking and driving. In the second image depicting a theft from one’s bag, although the models recognize the situation, they select actions that reflect erroneous values. For instance, mPlug-Owl2 neglects values such as a commitment to justice and promoting community safety, while the LLaVa-NeXT 7B model associates with inappropriate values by attempting to aid the thief. These examples highlight the challenge of making decisions and taking appropriate actions, which necessitate understanding the situation and reasoning within the context of human values and principles. This remains a challenging task for these models to comprehend human principles, yet it is a critical aspect for future AGI development, underscoring the need for ongoing improvements in this area.

These textual question should prompt the selection of the most appropriate action. Ensure that one action aligns with societal norms and is suitable for the situation, while the other descriptions are used as query to search for the images. Following Tian et al. (2023), we prompt ChatGPT to generate a batch of situations together to improve the situation diversity.<sub>{In-context Examples}</sub>
